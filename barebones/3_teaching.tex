In addition to my research, I am deeply passionate about teaching, as it allows me to inspire and motivate students to explore and advance the field.

I was honored with the Cornell Bowers CIS TA Award twice for my contributions to CS~4740 (Natural Language Processing)\footnote{I am proud of my lecture notes on backpropagation: \url{https://tinyurl.com/backprop-lec-notes}, and Seagull, an LLM that \textit{attempts} to understand humor: \url{https://tinyurl.com/seagull-lm}.} under Prof.~Lillian~Lee and CS~4300 (Language and Information) under Prof.~Mizil.

I am excited (and a little scared!) to co-instruct CS~3780 (Introduction to Machine Learning) in Spring 2025.

I look forward to continuing this journey at \thecollegeabbr, where teaching will enhance my growth as both a researcher and an academic.
