\textbf{At \thecollegeabbr \thedeptabbr}, I am particularly interested in working with \theprofs, whose work aligns closely with my research goal of advancing long-context modeling architectures.
%
\prof{1}'s research on linear attention architectures, such as GLA and DeltaNet, which are compute-efficient and hardware-aware, complements my focus on developing scalable and efficient models for long-context tasks. 
%
I am also interested in \prof{2}'s work on understanding how Transformers enable in-context learning, as this could be invaluable for designing recurrent models that manage information effectively across attention windows.
%
Additionally, \prof{3}'s work on efficient retrieval models aligns with my objectives of enhancing recall capabilities in linear-time architectures for long-context retrieval.
