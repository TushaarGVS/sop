Given my research goal of advancing long-context modeling architectures, I am particularly interested in working with \theprofs at \thecollegeabbr \thedeptabbr. 
%
\prof{1}'s lab extensively explores alternate-attention architectures that are inherently compute-efficient (e.g., S4 models, Morach mixer, Based) and hardware-aware (e.g., Flast-$\ast$, ThunderKittens), which aligns closely with my focus on developing scalable, efficient long-context models.
%
I am also interested in \prof{2}'s work on understanding how Transformers enable in-context learning, as this could be invaluable for designing recurrent models that manage information effectively across attention windows.
%
\prof{3}'s research on self-supervised learning via test-time training enhances the expressivity of hidden states in recurrent models, aligning with my objectives of improving recall capacity in linear-time models.
