%-JPC: Now that I think about it, this paragraph is really awkwardly positioned. The next paragraph mostly summarizes research progress, which makes it feel more like a conclusion to the previous paragraphs about your research.
%-JPC: So overall the flow feels like research -> teaching (briefly) -> back to research. I wonder if one way to address this is to put this paragraph *earlier*, before you start getting into the details of your research (since the earlier parts of the statement are more "about you" which fits well with talking about your passion for teaching).
%-JPC: Doing this would also have the neat side-effect of making it clear that teaching isn't just an afterthought (this would have been more important in a statement for a teaching-track job position rather than a PhD, but in the case of a PhD program I imagine very few applicants will even bring up teaching at all, so this might be a way to make yourself stand out!)

Alongside my research, I am deeply passionate about teaching, as it allows me to inspire and motivate students to explore and advance the field.

I was awarded the Cornell Bowers CIS TA Award twice for my contributions to CS~4740 (Natural Language Processing)\footnote{I am particularly proud of my lecture notes on backpropagation: \url{https://tinyurl.com/backprop-lec-notes}, and Seagull, an LLM that \textit{attempts} to understand humor: \url{https://tinyurl.com/seagull-lm}.} under Prof.~Lillian~Lee and CS~4300 (Language and Information) under Prof.~Mizil.
