- Research statement is a bit casual. I think you can include the technical parts.
    - Start with the goals, then get to the technical methodology, i.e. first paragraph what are you trying to do, then, how are you trying to do it

- I think you need a slightly higher level introduction about what you are interested in. Remember, you sould like to be admitted to places that might be interested in a broader set of topics than just Linear RNNs.
