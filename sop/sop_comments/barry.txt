(Following Yann's suggestions ...)

Yeah I agree. Parenthesis is distracting. No one will look at citation so potentially footnote them instead. The first impression of what you did come too late, and I think it might be better to have at least high level summarization of what you are up to rather then what the field is up to. If they know they know, and they are only assessing if you have a lot of experiences on the field rather than trying to take your pitch. Your pitch at the end of the date doesnâ€™t matter that much because what you work on depends on the grant.

And no you dont use we, or only infrequently. You must describe what you contribute and what excites you

Also you are selling yourself low buy not emphasizing that you are the colecturer for the ML class. No do not put down the course number.
