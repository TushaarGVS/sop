(Yann's messages transcribed using some software by Barry.)

Excluding the first audio msg:

Let me help organize this transcribed audio message, which appears to be feedback on a written document. I'll break it down into main points and concerns:

1	Technical Content Feedback:
	•	Discussion about "GT 40 step wise internalization" and "implicit chain"
	•	Confusion about O(1) notation/optimization discussion
	•	Question about why certain factors are described as implicit when they seem explicit
	•	Notes that "step wise internalization" seems unfamiliar as a technical term

2	Writing Style and Structure Concerns:
    A. Parentheses Usage:
    	•	Questions the necessity of parentheses throughout the document
    	•	Suggests content in parentheses could stand alone in the text
    	•	Recommends removing parentheses to make points stronger
    B. Tone and Academic Style:
    	•	Identifies certain parts as too informal/blog-like
    	•	Notes "in my experience" sections feel too anecdotal
    	•	Suggests making it more academic by:
        	◦	Adding specific references to papers
        	◦	Including experimental results
        	◦	Being more precise with claims

3	Introductory Section Feedback:
	•	Questions whether first sentence properly introduces all stages
	•	Suggests strengthening opening by:
    	◦	Making author involvement clearer
    	◦	Starting with "we aim to explore" rather than current phrasing
    	◦	Being more direct about collaborative nature ("we" instead of passive voice)
	
4	Conclusion Recommendations:
	•	Remove "a little scared" phrase
	•	Make final sentence more impactful ("punchier")
	•	Current ending feels flat
	•	Suggests bookending document with strong opening and closing statements

5	General Observations:
	•	Overall positive assessment of coherence and flow
	•	Acknowledges document supports main arguments well
	•	Notes viewing links is challenging (reviewer is on phone)
	•	Identifies possible bleeding of blog-writing style into academic writing
	
6	Next Steps:
	•	Requests another draft after revisions
	•	Maintains supportive tone while offering constructive criticism

The message concludes with a casual "peace peace" sign-off, suggesting an informal relationship between reviewer and author.
